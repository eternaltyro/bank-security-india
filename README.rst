Introduction
------------

After several frustrating moments while using Internet-banking platforms for even the most basic stuff, I began documenting how different banks handle user-side security. I was not-surprised to find that quite a few banks had severe restrictions on the quality of passwords the users can use. Several other banks even used the on-screen keypad in a laughable attempt to presumably  thwart key-logging attacks.

I began documenting some of the parameters that define end-user security for different banks. I even ran a survey (that received luke warm response) to crowdsource data about several banks. I compiled the data into a JSON file. Then I stumbled upon Rodolphe Breard's "bankageeks" project. That's where I picked up the idea to present the data on "Read the docs". 

This project documents only the banks operating in India. If you wish to do a similar project for banks in your country, you can do so by forking this project.
